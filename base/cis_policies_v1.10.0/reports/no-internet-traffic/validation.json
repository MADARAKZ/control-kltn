      "The `is_pod_isolated` and `is_service_protected` functions are using `exists(data.kubernetes.networking.k8s.io.networkpolicies[_])` as a placeholder. This only checks if *any* NetworkPolicy exists in the cluster, which is insufficient to properly determine isolation/protection. A complete solution requires querying existing NetworkPolicy objects that apply to the target Pod or Service and evaluating their ingress/egress rules. This is a significant simplification and may lead to incorrect results. Consider implementing the full logic using external data lookups.",
      "The `contains_cidr(egress, cidr)` function handles the case of no egress rules by considering it a violation. While this aligns with the requirement to restrict all traffic, it might be too strict in some scenarios. Consider adding an option to allow policies with no egress rules or adjusting the logic based on organizational needs."
